        <h1 id="title">The Silly Silly Hilly Silly Hills</h1>
        <p id="start">
            The sign points upwards, a gigantic pile of rubble and trinkets standing below it, the size of a hill...
        </p>
        <p id="climb_start">
            A circular path surrounding the mound led you in a trek, far above the clouds, in your search for the top of
            this crooked, leaning hill, made of all kinds of trinkets. As you go upwards, you find all kinds of new
            artifacts for your collection. Motors, microcontrollers, gears, wires, and even a few batteries.
        </p>
        <p id="climb_middle">
            As you continue your way upwards, you notice that the trinkets start to become more complex, from simple
            mechanical parts to intricate electronic devices. Cameras, sensors, and even small computers are now part
            of the hill, though the smaller trinkets haven't diminished in number too much, barely reducing in your
            sightings. By this point, you had left the mass of clouds long ago, and the sky was becoming a clearer shade
            of blue every moment, the sun shining brightly above you.
        </p>
        <p id="almost_there">
            As you continue climbing, you find a small sign, with something hanging from it. It reads as follows:
        </p>
        <h1 id="the_sign">
            You have made it so far, traveler! But you are not yet at the top! Take this, least you drown yourself in
            the vacuum of space!
        </h1>
        <p id="aaaaalmost_there">
            Below the sign, a spacesuit leans sadly against it, its size just right for you. You put it on, and breathe
            the fresh air. You feel revitalized, and ready to take on the final stretch to the top of the hill. Who is
            the strange person who wrote these signs? Who is at the top of the hill? You really badly want to find out,
            don't you?
        </p>
        <h1 id="neon_sign">Heidi's Hideout</h1>
        <p id="entrance">
            The sign shines brightly in the darkness of space, as you reach the summit of the hill. You look around, and
            there's nothing but the dimly lit shed in front of you. You walk towards it, and see a small door just big
            enough for you to fit if you crouch a little bit.
        </p>
        <p id="interior1">
            You do so, and enter the small shed. Inside, you see a cozy little room. In one of the corners, there's a
            small racoon sewing something, whilst a small black kitten lies on her lap. In the other side of the room,
            a woman lays on a couch, sound asleep, a book over her chest. The floor of the shed is full of boxes and
            trinkets, and a small table with a lamp and a cup of tea sits in the middle of the room, a circuit board
            and a heated soldering iron next to it.
        </p>
        <p id="interior2">
            The racoon looks towards you as you enter, with a warm smile on her face. "We were waiting for you!", she
            says. "You found my little hideout, after all that hard work! Now, why don't you sit down and have a cup of
            tea, honey? You can get to work whenever you want!"
        </p>
        <p id="interior3">
            You sit down, and the racoon pours you a cup of tea. You sip it, it's just perfectly warm and sweetened.
            Around the room, you see all kinds of trinkets, some you recognize, even having seen them in the hill you
            just climbed. Others, you have no idea what they are, and a few weren't even on the pile. You feel like you
            are home, in this place full of trinkets. You felt motivated, and looked at the board in front of you. It
            seemed to be some kind of small keyboard. Why not try and solder it?
        </p>
        <p id="soldering">
            You pick up the soldering iron, and start to work on the circuit board. You solder the components without
            too much trouble, only needing to redo one or two connections. The racoon watches you all along, smiling
            warmly. "You know, I used to be like you. Always tinkering with things, trying to make them better. But
            then I realized that sometimes, it's not about making things better, but about making them work for you.
            That's why I built this little hideout, to have a place where I can be myself, and work on my own projects,
            without anyone telling me what to do."
        </p>
        <p id="the_end">
            As you finish soldering, the racoon tells you that it's time for her to go back to her work. She gives the
            keyboard to you, and tells you that you can keep it, as well as anything else you might find on the hill.
            She waves you off as you exit the shed. You go down the hill, and in your way, you pick a few of the
            trinkets you find around. You feel happy, and content, knowing that you have found a place you can come back
            to work on your projects, at your own pace, without anyone telling you what to do.
        </p>
        <h1 id="next_title">The Silly Silly Hilly Silly Hills</h1>
        <p id="next">
            As you reach the bottom of the hill, you wonder where you should go next. On one direction, you hear a faint
            giggle coming from far away, as if someone had just heard a wonderful joke. On the other direction, you hear
            a running river, the sound of water flowing and splashing against the rocks. Which way do you go? Do you go
            <a href="https://summer.hackclub.com/s?scene=52">Towards the giggles?</a> Or do you go
            <a href="https://summer.hackclub.com/s?scene=29">Towards the running river?</a> Make your decision, and see
            where your adventure takes you next!
