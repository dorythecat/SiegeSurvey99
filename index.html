        <h1 id="title">The Silly Silly Hilly Silly Hills</h1>
        <p id="start">
            The sign points upwards, a gigantic pile of rubble and trinkets standing below it, the size of a hill...
        </p>
        <p id="climb_start">
            A circular path surrounding the mound led you in a trek, far above the clouds, in your search for the top of
            this crooked, leaning hill, made of all kinds of trinkets. As you go upwards, you find all kinds of new
            artifacts for your collection. Motors, microcontrollers, gears, wires, and even a few batteries.
        </p>
        <p id="climb_middle">
            As you continue your way upwards, you notice that the trinkets start to become more complex, from simple
            mechanical parts to intricate electronic devices. Cameras, sensors, and even small computers are now part
            of the hill, though the smaller trinkets haven't diminished in number too much, barely reducing in your
            sightings. By this point, you had left the mass of clouds long ago, and the sky was becoming a clearer shade
            of blue every moment, the sun shining brightly above you.
        </p>
        <p id="almost_there">
            As you continue climbing, you find a small sign, with something hanging from it. It reads as follows:
        </p>
        <h1 id="the_sign">
            You have made it so far, traveler! But you are not yet at the top! Take this, least you drown yourself in
            the vacuum of space!
        </h1>
        <p id="aaaaalmost_there">
            Below the sign, a spacesuit leans sadly against it, its size just right for you. You put it on, and breathe
            the fresh air. You feel revitalized, and ready to take on the final stretch to the top of the hill. Who is
            the strange person who wrote these signs? Who is at the top of the hill? You really badly want to find out,
            don't you?
        </p>
